**Just some tweaks that I want to add.**

## Features

- **windowResizable** : Set whether the game window size can be changed.
- **quickCraftWithRecipeBook** : Holding Shift and clicking on a recipe item in the RecipeBook will craft all available items in your inventory into that item at once. This feature relies on the **ItemScroller**.
- **ignoreSpecNBTTagsWhenSort** : When using OMMC, ignore items with specified NBT tags when sorting items.
- **fixTweakerooGammaOverride** : Fixed the issue that **Tweakeroo**'s gamma override did not take effect when the client was launched.
