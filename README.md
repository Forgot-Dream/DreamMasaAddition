# DreamMasaAddition

Just some tweaks that I want to add.

## Features

- **windowResizable** : Set whether the game window size can be changed.
- **quickCraftWithRecipeBook** : Holding Shift and clicking on a recipe item in the RecipeBook will craft all available items in your inventory into that item at once. This feature relies on the **ItemScroller**.

## Dependenies

- Minecraft 1.20.1-1.20.2
- [MagicLib](https://github.com/Hendrix-Shen/MagicLib) >= 0.7.398

## Development

Issues and PRs are welcome.
